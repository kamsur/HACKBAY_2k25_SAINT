# create a python code for the following task:
# **User Story**  
# 1. As a developer
# 2. I want to pull issues from a GitHub Projects Kanban board
# 3. So that I can automate feature development based on project planning

# **Acceptance Criteria**
# - A script uses the GitHub API to access the list of open issues from a specified project board
# - Issues are filtered based on status (e.g., "To Do", "Ready")
# - Retrieved issues are logged or displayed in an organized format (e.g., JSON or table)
# - The script/tool allows specifying repository and project identifiers

# **Definition of Done (DoD)**
# - Code is committed to a version-controlled repository
# - Documentation includes usage instructions
# - Tool has been reviewed by another developer
# - GitHub Actions workflows for linting pass
# - Feature branch has been merged and deleted
